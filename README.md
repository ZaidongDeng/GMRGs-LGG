Title: Glutathione Metabolism-Related Gene Signature Predicts Prognosis and Treatment Response in Low-Grade Glioma

Overview: This repository contains the code associated with the research project titled "Glutathione Metabolism-Related Gene Signature Predicts Prognosis and Treatment Response in Low-Grade Glioma". The study aimed to investigate the relationship between glutathione metabolism-related genes (GMRGs) and low-grade glioma (LGG) prognosis. Based on GMRGs, this study establishes a robust prognostic signature that can serve as an independent prognostic factor and is instructive for chemotherapy and immunotherapy. Experiments were also performed to demonstrate the importance of glutathione metabolism in LGG progression and chemotherapy resistance. In this study, a variety of bioinformatics analysis methods were used, including consensus clustering analysis, machine learning, Kaplan-Meier (K-M) survival analysis, GO enrichment analysis, KEGG enrichment analysis, GSEA, GSVA, ESTIMATE algorithm, drug susceptibility analysis, Mendelian randomization analysis, Univariate Cox analysis, Multivariate cox analysis, etc.
